"""# Load the data

'torchvision' is used to load the data ([documentation](http://pytorch.org/docs/0.3.0/torchvision/index.html)). The dataset is split into two parts, training and validation. For the training, you'll want to apply transformations such as random scaling, cropping, and flipping. This will help the network generalize leading to better performance. If you use a pre-trained network, you'll also need to make sure the input data is resized to 224x224 pixels as required by the networks.

The validation set is used to measure the model's performance on data it hasn't seen yet. For this you don't want any scaling or rotation transformations, but you'll need to resize then crop the images to the appropriate size.

The pre-trained networks available from 'torchvision' were trained on the ImageNet dataset where each color channel was normalized separately. For both sets you'll need to normalize the means and standard deviations of the images to what the network expects. For the means, it's ' [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]'  and for the standard deviations ''[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]' , calculated from the ImageNet images.  These values will shift each color channel to be centered at 0 and range from -1 to 1.

"""# Class Prediction

Once you can get images in the correct format, it's time to write a function for making predictions with your model. A common practice is to predict the top 5 or so (usually called top-$K$) most probable classes. You'll want to calculate the class probabilities then find the $K$ largest values.

To get the top $K$ largest values in a tensor use [`x.topk(k)`](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/torch.html#torch.topk). This method returns both the highest `k` probabilities and the indices of those probabilities corresponding to the classes. You need to convert from these indices to the actual class labels using `class_to_idx` which hopefully you added to the model or from an `ImageFolder` you used to load the data ([see here](#Save-the-checkpoint)). Make sure to invert the dictionary so you get a mapping from index to class as well.

Again, this method should take a path to an image and a model checkpoint, then return the probabilities and classes.

probs, classes = predict(image_path, model)
print(probs)
print(classes)
