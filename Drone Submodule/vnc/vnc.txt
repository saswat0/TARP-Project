instructions
------------
1.first get updates
	sudo apt-get update

2.install tightvnc
	sudo apt-get install tightvncserver

3.Start server and configure a password
	/usr/bin/tightvncserver

password is 8 char long so eg is: 
	raspberr

no need for a view only password

When the server starts it will tell you which virtual desktop has been setup. In this case:
New 'X' desktop is raspberrypi:1
says that it's virtual desktop 1. You would connect to this using :1 at the end of the IP address in the client,
this is the one we will setup to start automatically later.

4.Adding Tightvnc to systemd startup
	sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/tightvncserver.service

copy the following and paste
----------------------------------

[Unit]
Description=TightVNC remote desktop server
After=sshd.service
 
[Service]
Type=dbus
ExecStart=/usr/bin/tightvncserver :1
User=pi
Type=forking
 
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target


------------------------------------
You may need to change the user name on line 8. It is currently set to pi which is the default 
username on the Raspberry Pi Raspbian image. Set this to whatever username you want to login to TightVNC as. 
Do not put root as the user.

5.Change the file so it is owned by root
	sudo chown root:root /etc/systemd/system/tightvncserver.service

6.Make the file executable by running
	sudo chmod 755 /etc/systemd/system/tightvncserver.service

7.It's a good idea to test the script at this point rather than waiting until after a reboot. This is done using:
	sudo systemctl start tightvncserver.service

Don't worry if you get the following error message, which is because you've already started tightvnc
A VNC server is already running as :1

8.Enable startup at boot using
	sudo systemctl enable tightvncserver.service
